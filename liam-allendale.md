# Allendale

### The fire festival

- Takes place at New Year
- Casting out spirits of the previous year
- Seems pagan, is actaully just for tourists
- Everybody gets **very** drunk

### Mining

- Used to be a lead mining town
- The Blacket level was a tunnel that ran across the entire valley
- Entrance of the tunnel is rumoured to be the very center of the UK!
