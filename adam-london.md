# London

## Food

- Nanban in Brixton does something very interesting with jackfruit.
- Adulis in Oval is a pretty good Eritrean restaurant.
- A guy at ScandiMarket in Canada Water does very good Norwegian fish broth, about twice a year.
- You can get noodles at Wagamama's, but I wouldn't recommend it.

## Not food

- The foxes in Canada Water.
- The Portobello market (don't be misled by the reference to mushrooms).
